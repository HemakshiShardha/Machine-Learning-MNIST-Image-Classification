# Machine-Learning-MNIST-Image-Classification
Used Machine Learning algorithms on MNIST dataset to classify images of digits.

In this project, I used Logistic Regression, Bayesian Logistic Regression and SVM to classify the images of digits from MNIST dataset.

Feel free to check the Jupyter Notebook for the code and details!
